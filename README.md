# engine (2011)
======

This was my thesis project, a 3D engine written in C++ using OpenGL ES rendering.
Main features: normal mapping, scene and resource management, post-processing effects (e.g. DOF, bloom)

Camera movement:

- w/a/s/d -> forward/backward/left/right
- x/space -> down/up
- mouse   -> hold left button to rotate
- TAB     -> hold for movement speedup (4x)
